SteGUI TODO list!
Last updated: Apr 10, 2005

* A LOT of cleaning up and modularization
* Improve use of Pstreams
* Revise audio playback. Make it more flexible and add functionality and reliability. Drop aplay code?
* Migrate to FLTK 2.0
* Windows port (needs Windows-compatible Pstreams library and Windows audio support)
